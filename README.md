LAB1_P1:This Java program validates an 8- or 9-digit credit card number using a variation of the Luhn algorithm:
Length Check: Ensures the card number is 8 or 9 digits.
Checksum Calculation: Doubles every other digit (from the right), adjusting if >9, and sums them.
Validation: Compares the last digit with the calculated checksum to determine if the card is valid.
In main, the user enters a number, and the program outputs whether the card is "valid" or "invalid."
(This approach is simplified for hypothetical card numbers, not standard credit cards.)
